# SpeechToText
Final project for my BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE class.

This project focuses on building a Speech-to-Text system using deep learning techniques. It explores key concepts in natural language processing (NLP) and automatic speech recognition (ASR), integrating business intelligence insights from spoken language data.

Project Goals
- Convert audio speech into text accurately.
- Preprocess and clean audio and textual data.
- Train deep learning models for transcription.
- Compare the different model's results.

Trained Models
The following models were trained and evaluated:

- RNN with bidirectional LTSM
- RNN Seq2Seq + Attention
- CNN
- Transformer Wav2Vec2 fine-tuned
